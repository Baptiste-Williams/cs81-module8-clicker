# Cookie Clicker Reflection

## What helped you understand DOM interaction best?
Honestly, just seeing how `document.getElementById()` connects the HTML to the JavaScript made it click for me. Once I started updating counters and messages dynamically, I could see how the DOM responds to user actions in real time. That hands-on feedback helped me understand how everything ties together.

## How did you choose your milestone messages?
I started with the ones from the assignment, but I wanted to make them feel more fun and personalized. So I added messages like “Chocolate overload!” and “Mixing it up ” depending on which button was clicked. It gave each theme its own vibe and made the app more engaging.

## What challenge or bug surprised you?
Getting the DUI overlay and BAC warning to trigger correctly was tricky. I had to make sure the drink counters were updating and that the BAC calculation only showed the warning at the right time. Also, getting the flashing background and siren to work together took some trial and error, but I figured it out.
still not sure if the siren works but I needed to move on.

## What personal twist did you add?
I added two full themes: Cookie Clicker and Alcohol Tracker. Each has three buttons with their own counters and milestone messages. I also built a BAC calculator that gives a warning if your BAC is 0.09 or higher. And if you drink 20 or more drinks, the app shows a flashing red and blue overlay with sirens, skulls, and a bold message to call a ride. It’s a creative twist with a serious message.

## What real-world app uses this kind of interaction?
Apps like fitness trackers, habit builders, and even games like BitLife or Cookie Clicker use this kind of interaction. They respond to clicks, update stats, and give feedback based on milestones. It’s a simple way to keep users engaged and aware of their progress.
Over all this whole module was great, really had me going down the rabbit hole.
